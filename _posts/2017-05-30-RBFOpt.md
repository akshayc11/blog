This post is a synopsis of my understanding of the RBFOpt article described by Diaz et al.

# [RBFOpt: An effective algorithm for hyperparameter optimization of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08520)

## My Synopsis

In this paper, the authors formulate the hyperparameter optimization problem for neural networks as a [box-constrained problem](https://www.ime.usp.br/~egbirgin/publications/bm3.pdf) (the link is the pointer to a paper that talks about it. Not sure if its the most apt citation), and claim that this is empirically a better representation than the normal formulation (). They describe an extention to [derivative free optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization) algorithms implemented in RBFOpt: a radial basis function model with
thin plate splines, combined with a polynomial tail of degree 1.

For their objective, they consider two different metrics to maximize, and consider a weighted sum of these:

1. Distance of a point from previously computed values. (_Exploration_)
2. Performance of a point in terms of the surrogate function (the RBF model with splines). (_Exploitation_)

The weight will indicate how much emphasis is to be placed on one over the other.
The weight follows a cyclic strategy that will alternate between exploration and exploitation over the number of iterations of hyperparameter optimization.

To determine the best for the surrogate function, they employ a round of GA to find the surrogate function value at different points.


## Doubts:
I am as of yet, unclear about how they use RBFOpt here. I guess more information should be found in [this paper](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2014/09/4538.pdf). I will need to read and understand this before I can make any final comments.
